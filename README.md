# Quail Egg Laying Daylight Scheduler v1.03
<b>Program to calculate how many hours of artificial light needed for proper Coturnix Quail egg laying.<BR>
After setting up your Latitude, Longitude, and time zone parameters, the program will calculate how<BR>
many additional current day daylight hours are needed to reach the proper daylight needed for<BR>
maximized egg laying (usually 16 hours).  The 'Timer current day:' shows the time to set a timer to<BR>
turn on (Start:) and off (End:) artificial light.  The program should be consulted at least twice a month<BR>
(1st and 15th) or weekly to keep proper timer settings, which can vary widely during some months of<BR>
the year.
