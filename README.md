# Quail Egg Laying Daylight Scheduler
Program to calculate how many hours of artificial light needed for proper Coturnix Quail egg laying.<BR>
After setting up your Latitude, Longitude, and time zone parameters, the program will calculate how<BR>
many additional daylight hours are needed to reach the proper daylight needed for maximum egg<BR>
laying (usually 16 hours).  The 'Timer current day' shows the time to set a timer to turn on (Start:) and<BR>
off (End:) artificial light.
